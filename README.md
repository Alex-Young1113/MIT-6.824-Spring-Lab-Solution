My personal implementation of Raft based on lab assignments from [MIT 6.824 2021S](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2021/schedule.html).
To run the gotests, run following command:
```cd ./raft && go test -race```
Currently, gotests from 2A, 2B are tested for hundreds of times without failure. First 4 tests from 2C are also passed. I will proceed to pass the remaining gotests, hopefully in near future.
